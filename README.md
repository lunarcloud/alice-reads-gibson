# Alice Reads Gibson

Virtual Reality Components and Demos

## SDKs
Under Assets, there are different sections for the different VR SDKs. Scenes and Code that is specific to an implementation should exist entirely within the folder of the SDK. 
Scenes and Code that do not rely upon any particular implementation should exist outside these folders.

## Art Assets
These will live within a separate git repository, provided as a submodule within 'Assets' known as "Dali Reads Gibson".
