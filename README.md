# Alice Reads Gibson

Virtual Reality Components and Demos.

**[PATIENCE]** while we wrap our heads around redoing what we had in GoogleVR API in the new Unity XR API. We've had to go back to square nearly-one while we do this.

## Headsets
Supporting multiple headsets through Unity XR API now instead of multiple API implementations.

## Art Assets
These will live within a separate git repository, provided as a submodule within 'Assets' known as "Dali Reads Gibson".
